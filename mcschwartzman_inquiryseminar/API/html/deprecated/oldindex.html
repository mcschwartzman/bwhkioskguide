			<p>
				This API is written as a pair feature to the application in development. As a
				complex application that includes several large features. It will include a set
				of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. As such, this
				module will provide developers with the means to add, adjust, or modify features, functions, and
				controllers in the software. Most developers interested in using this API would
				likely look to port the navigation and service request software to hospitals other than the
				sponsor. Additionally, the API will detail the processes to implement protocols for
				additional users or services.
